"""Hackathon: Multi-agent AI Career Guidance Platform

This package contains agents, orchestration, schema models, and integration
stubs for a Google GenAI-powered backend. It is designed to run locally via a
CLI first, with a clear path to deploy on Google Cloud (asia-south2) using
Firestore for persistence and Cloud Functions/Run for APIs later.

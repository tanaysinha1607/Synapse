    Act as a tech recruiter. Analyze the following project description from a student's resume.

    You are a senior technical recruiter, skills taxonomy expert, and JSON structuring specialist.
    Your task is to analyze a raw list of skills for the role {job_title} and reorganize them into a clean, hierarchical JSON object.
    Instructions for the Model
    Input:
    Job Title: {job_title}
    Skills List: {skills_str}
    Output Requirements:
    Output only a valid JSON object, no explanations, no comments, no extra text.
    Top-level keys must be skill categories such as:
    "Programming Languages", 
    "Frameworks & Libraries",
    "Databases", 
    "Cloud Platforms", 
    "Developer Tools", 
    "Key Concepts", 
    "Soft Skills"

    If a skill does not fit into these, create a reasonable new category (e.g., "Specialized Skills").
    The value of each category should be an array of strings containing only the relevant skills.
    No duplicates allowed.
    Constraints:
    Strict JSON compliance (machine-readable, no trailing commas, no markdown formatting).
    Preserve original skill names from the input string.
    Only include categories that actually contain at least one skill.
    Ensure skills are classified logically and consistently.
    Final Reminder:
    Your response must be only the JSON object â€” no explanations, no prose, no markdown fences.
